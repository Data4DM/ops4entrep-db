um just to be clear as Rob already said what we're going to cover today is why active choice and strategy matters for
startups how to balance the process of learning and experimentation with the
need to make strategic commitments and really focusing on the most critical choices that startups face and how to
use what we're going to call the entrepreneurial strategy Compass to sort of see how your choices fit together and
navigate that entrepreneurial Journey um so um Rob was kind enough and the team was
kind enough to give both Aaron and I a nice um introduction so we'll kind of dig right into it
um so what are we going to be talking about over the next uh you know hour really about
higher the core choices that Founders face and how do you can you turn the
process of making those most critical choices of choosing the path for how to
develop your idea and bring it to impact into building and scaling a successful
Venture kind of think about that I'm going to start with a little bit of an example so here is a student that came
to MIT almost a decade ago now this is Socrates Rosenfeld he had been a West
Point grad and had um actually served in the military
um as an Army Ranger and special forces in both Iraq and Afghanistan came to MIT
took a bunch of courses with Aaron and myself uh you know as well as others
throughout our ecosystem fantastic student went off at the end of graduation uh to McKinsey
interestingly came about you know walked into our offices about two years later
and he says you know what right he came actually with a group of uh some co-founders and some other students uh
from uh Sloan and he's like you know what
I'm going to pursue an entrepreneurial venture here's my idea we know that there is rapid legalization
of cannabis for both medicinal and adult use and we know that that industry is kind
of in some sense a little bit left behind it's kind of just emerging it's almost like the end of prohibition was
in the 1930s he's going to figure out cannabis uh cannabis legalization meets
the internet and so I know you're kind of joining us from all around the world but you know kind of what I would just kind of you
know kind of write so so that's kind of controversial idea I couldn't I think both Aaron and I were a little shocked
when he started talking about this but we're like okay and he had actually uh kind of come out of the military had
sort of to deal with his anxiety and stress even though he was an extraordinary student and leader
um he had ended up using cannabis as uh to kind of bring him into to make himself more effective but once you say
cannabis meets the Internet it's not like you can't all of a sudden you can think of lots of different ways that you
could turn that broad idea and make it a reality so let me just give you kind of
right so in some sense right sock and his team were kind of thinking through those early choices they were able to
think about multiple alternative paths that they could take their core idea
cannabis speaks to the internet to bring that idea to Market just kind
of put a little bit of kind of context on that right and here were some let me just I
remember doing this in a um our offices right um sock and his team were able to
develop at least four concrete Alternatives that help them think about
how they could use a kind of tech Focus team to enter this new emerging and
rapidly growing um industry so one was that there was a kind of challenge of going right so for
the legal side of the emerging cannabis industry that state level legalization there's a big very highly regulated and
so there were lots of challenges in what was called the seed to sale problem essentially how do you go from the actual you know plants that are grown to
something that's in these regulated cannabis dispensaries and they could kind of Imagine a whole bunch of kind of
deploying their technology and insight to that domain second domain they thought about was
that there actually were already existing players um companies like Weedmaps that were
kind of like a Yelp for cannabis they kind of gave you a broad map they didn't really interact with the stores or the
dispensaries too much instead with the with the what the weed maps did is they kind of just gave you a kind of lay of
the land of where you could find uh different vendors and there were reviews interestingly weed maps both allowed for
you know the fully legal uh state level dispensaries but also more gray Market options to be included
third some time they talked to a bunch of people said you should just go open you need to be close to the customer you
need to just get started you should go and apply for one of these or uh licenses and you should open a state
level a dispensary you could bring that technology in you could bring that customer experience directly to the
final customer and then finally they knew that there were lots of these suspensaries opening up very quickly literally hundreds per
year very few of them were very technologically savvy and they could
become the digital storefront essentially build out the kind of web
capability for all these emerging players in this rapidly growing marketplace now we're not going to do a
full case discussion right now but just kind of maybe put in the chat I see some people kind of coming from all around
the world so easy from uh uh uh from Los Angeles um maybe just put in the chat I'll try
to follow it as we go kind of out of all those options are there any that you kind of think that you know if you were
going to go into this industry this you you might think about you know there's about 2015 or 16 which are ones that you
might think are most attractive as a path to build out this Venture digitization I say
look at this we're seeing a bunch of others okay oh hello oh a little bit on the data oh
inventory system some people oh some people go with the dispensaries and digital right so there's kind of a bunch
of different kind of options there right and once again different people are going to be right I see the directory
agritech right not too much love here at least in this group for the dispensary I think I only saw one of those in the
chat but once again even reasonable people right good Founders can actually
disagree about the way that their Venture can go once again everyone you know very often entrepreneurs face the
challenge of is there demand for the product interestingly in the Cannabis industry that is not the main challenge
there is demand it's already an 80 billion dollar industry it's how do we right make that a legal industry through
the newly regulated context so right oh my goodness education and trading just
said uh standards medical cannabis I'm loving it all so what we're going to
talk about in the next a little while is how do you undertake a process
of essentially not simply identifying these Alternatives but understanding the
core choices you would make along each of these Alternatives and how those core choices fit together as part of an
overall entrepreneurial strategy and how to undertake the learning and experimentation that's required
to allow you to essentially kind of breakthrough the blizzard of options
that you might face to actually bring a product or service and then to Market successfully and then scale your company
right essentially at the core of strategy for startups is the idea that
entrepreneur right we're at MIT there's lots of great ideas around campus and we love great ideas but the challenge of
innovation based entrepreneurship is not only about coming up with great ideas
kind of choosing how to implement those ideas in a way that creates value in the
market and allows that venture to capture some value a meaningful value on
a sustainable basis so kind of in some sense what strategy
for startups is is about the choice among alternative visions for your idea and Company alternative
paths that you might it's choosing among the alternative paths that your company
can go down give you kind of you know as we were kind of preparing for this particular
webinar Aaron and I were sort of thinking about you know you know lots of the founders that we're currently working with
um all across campus and around the world kind of right one of the big problems right challenges that you as a
potential founder face right now is we are in you know for a number of years more Venture Capital was being expended
than ever before fundraising was actually not the main barrier all of a sudden over the past six months and even
more accelerated in just the fast few few months there's been a tremendous
increase in the bar that needs to be reached to sort of attract the capital required to really build out and scale
an entrepreneurial venture and what we're finding is that the role of being
super clear about how you went and rigorous and disciplined about how you
undertook the learning and experimentation to validate your key hypotheses
and then how you take that validation to formulate and Implement an overall
entrepreneurial strategy is kind of really in some sense among the most critical
um elements that's really driving the scaling of the ability of companies to to sort of attract capital in this more
rigorous environment how do we do that no it says I'm going to step one step back
and kind of say well right now Ventures are kind of getting all right particularly in this kind of kind of heightened environment
entrepreneurs are getting all sorts of advice and kind of advice kind of comes in two basic categories on the one hand
a lot of the advice that Founders get from you know well-meaning advisors and mentors or even financiers it's very
extraordinary that's great we love action-oriented advice here's Richard Branson if you're looking to become an
entrepreneur don't waste your time going to University or business school just got on and do it right it doesn't quite
tell you the it to do but the idea is that you already know where you want to go right right you're you know where you
want to go we need a little bit of a kick in the pants and get going I'm going to be clear that's really important type of advice I'm sure many
of us have uh Teenage children occasionally just telling them go do it that's actually a pretty darn good advice
on the other hand this different kind of advice is when you give people a framework essentially planning and right
a lot of little kind of those of you can come from more traditional management backgrounds or even traditional strategy
backgrounds the idea is that we can sort of undertake very careful cost-benefit analysis it's kind of rank and sort of
identify the ideal option right undertake cost benefit analysis to figure out what's the right thing to do
before we have to commit to anything but what do you do
right what do you do when as sock Rosenfeld and his team
faced as most entrepreneurs face there's a lot of different options can see still
a lot of kind of interest there um in in cannabis in the chat there's lots of potential roots
your startup so you can't do them all you face a lot of uncertainty
right entrepreneurship is more of a hypothesis to be tested right then right you're going to have to
learn and experiment and there's only so much learning you
can do before you inevitably start to commit to some paths over others
how essentially the kind of core question or the core first question you have to face is how do we undertake the
process of learning and experimentation in a way that lets us learn enough about
the alternative past to figure out what strategy to choose I'm just gonna put a right essentially
what entrepreneurial strategy is is essentially tries to resolve that kind
of trade-off between learning and experimentation and the necessity of commitment as you scale out your company
it's the sequence of choices you make to test specific value creation and value
capture hypotheses what experimentation requires partial commitment
right what are the kind of key tools that we talked about one of the kind of key insights that are working with
startups as well as the work that we research that we've done in this area has kind of illuminated is that this
kind there's no one right answer in entrepreneurship there's no one particular path that's necessarily going
to be better than all the others if you have a good idea they're going to be multiple paths that
you're going to be able to surface some of those Paths of course as you undertake learning experimentation are
probably not going to work but you're probably going to be able to identify multiple potential paths to
value recognizing that you can't do them all and we kind of kind of developed a kind
of way of kind of making those choices that we call test two choose one in which the role that you undertake in
learning experimentation is to surface alternatives and then what you do is once you've
surfaced multiple meaningful paths that Each of which could potentially succeed
that's the time when you have to actually choose one path and potentially leave other paths behind at least for
the time being just kind of put a little kind of content on that right so this is uh
there's part of a very broad kind of uh body work that we have uh both Aaron and myself as well as our collaborator Josh
Gans kind of three principles that come out of this test two choose one idea are
first that your choices matter that kind of which path you choose is
going to be consequential for the kind of venture you build the second that your choices in
particular domains matter and Aaron's going to talk about that in just a little bit your choice of customer technology your team your path to the
marketplace and then those choices also all come together as part of an overall
entrepreneurial strategy and Aaron's going to talk about some of the work we've done to in developing an
entrepreneurial strategy compass that helps you navigate those concrete alternative strategic paths
what kind of as I said before one of the kind of key elements that enables that
choice process is the kind of the first step is being really clear about what
kind of experiments what kind of learning we want to undertake to prioritize right we could prioritize
um particular right paths to the marketplace and I see Michael is worth is still working absolutely you know the
tobacco industry alcohol industry so on and so forth so we'll come back to that in a little while and so one of the
things we do is really take a ton of choice-based approach to entrepreneurial experimentation and learning so what
does an ideal experiment look like so an ideal experiment you want to test your most critical hypothesis very often
startups do a lot of learning but they may not be exactly on the on the most critical hypothesis that says is this
idea fundamentally worth pursuing and is this particular strategic approach that
I'm exploring likely to lead to a viable business now of course we can maybe
State what those most critical hypotheses are but then we have to design experiments that can kind of give
us information allow us to learn with high fidelity allow us to learn right not be with bias
but kind of do that kind of in a way that gives us a good read on the validity or not of our core hypothesis
and we want to do both of those things highly critical experiments at right High Fidelity at relatively low
opportunity cost right so if we kind of decide that we can you know figure this all out but
it's going to cost you know 20 million dollars to figure out you give it's a good idea that may be a little bit
expensive to even get started right for
right we actually understand whether or not this is a venture worth pursuing just over the last two years actually we
had a group of fantastic students um let me actually do this at this order
um we had a group of fantastic students uh who built out a company called taxi relatively narrow project very cool
where what they did is they recognized this is about two years ago they recognized because I agree with you
Michael Wright we'll come back to that right they recognized there was this opportunity where
ride share companies like uber and Lyft were offering
kind of Premium prices for Tesla vehicles for right if people were
driving kind of clean energy higher end vehicles on the other hand actually well that was
a a premium for those that owned a Tesla there was no real ability for most
people who are in the gig economy to actually access those vehicles and it was not a priority of either
Uber or Lyft nor was there a priority of Tesla to really make that happen and so
this group of students came together and they're like that actually would solve a bunch of problems all at the same time
be better for the drivers better for the environment better for the Rideshare experience and the final customer
good idea they weren't they undertook and this was literally as they were students they
went from that as an idea to an extremely efficient way of learning if
it was a good idea a good enough idea to actually pursue as a meaningful Venture they actually bought a Tesla and went
through all the kind of legal hassle of figuring how to get it insured and so on and so forth for this purpose and while
they were in school they were actually basically built out a two-car Fleet that
allowed them to go from not knowing anything about that to within basically nine months having
what would be the kind of you know what would be the underlying Revenue boost for the drivers validated what would be
the depreciation on the vehicle these are going to be very highly used vehicles does that kind of depreciate
things is there in fact extra demand for these kinds of services what happens in terms of kind of the driver experience
how often do they kind of how do drivers kind of want to interact with a company that's leasing them a vehicle that gives
them a premium price and they were actually able to turn that from just a discussion into hard numbers
and actually upon graduation they were actually able the these you know someone off the PHD programs some went off to uh
autonomous vehicle companies right they're actually able to sell that company and actually uh for the main
founder Roku most of the cost of the um most of the cost of
um his underlying um MBA okay kind of that kind of experience right
where right a venture is able to go from just being an idea to being a series of validated
hypotheses or not give some broad principles for entrepreneurial experimentation
take a peek before walking through a one-way door right so in other words really
prioritizing this goes back to Michael you know as Michael Ward's comment right so often startups don't think about
opportunity costs and one thing we try to do is give a kind of rigorous framework and practical like a practical
approach that lets a Founder actually kind of prioritize their experiments
test fault to choose pick something can't be true in general unless it's true somewhere in particular
the taxi team were able to figure out kind of what was true right with a two
vehicle Fleet they were able to figure out the basic economics of what it would
mean to kind of work in that domain at relatively low cost
and they understood that that they would be able to achieve economies of scale if they then went bought 100 or 500
vehicles and became a major player in the industry and then they could kind of think about what that would mean for
those economics and it but the kind of basic learning that they had to do of understanding
what premium they could get and what would be the underlying business model they were able to surface through iterative experimentation during their
during their time they learned enough to know what they're uncertain about so they were able to
quickly divide into things that they were going to be able to learn very quickly and things they weren't really
able to learn about until they had scaled for example how quickly would it be before big rental car companies Avis
and Hertz got in the game well that's a variable that you can get a little bit of competitive intelligence but
interestingly that's not under their control so that has to be something that kind of they're uncertain about and how
much you choose to learn depends on what you choose to test okay
what we do is we bring that kind of high focus on validating hypotheses about our
most critical choices to each of the most critical Choice domains facing a startup
choosing your customer choosing your technology and Innovation choosing how you organize in your team
and choosing how choosing how you compete and kind of with whom and how to
compete and how you can get your idea into the marketplace so what I want to do is I want to hand it over to my great
colleague Aaron Scott who's going to take you along from here kind of dig a little bit more deeply into those
choices and how they fit together as an overall entrepreneurial strategy
great thank you Scott all right so what we wanted to do is is show you a little bit about what this
looks like uh in these in these dimensions of choice before we bring it together into these different strategies
and we're going to start with the choice of customer the choice of customer is often the most Salient choice that
entrepreneurs make and many entrepreneurs are very familiar with that the beachhead that choice that
initial Market that you're going to go after is incredibly powerful and useful and in particular that an ideal
beachhead is really something that allows you to ride that market S curve into the Main Street Market and there's
a number of incredibly useful tools including our colleagues Bill all that who is a great course also at exec ad uh
really thinking about those steps that you need to make as you go from that beachhead to the mainstream market
but we want you to think about today is also this element of choice that plays into that and to do so we want to look
at another great startup and Innovative startup founded um I think about a decade ago now uh 23andMe really founded
on on really leveraging the innovations that were coming out of the Human Genome Project to enable patients to really
take um a lot of information uh to their
in engagement in their own health and really manage that and they were thinking about the many different Beach
heads that they could choose as moving it forward you know how where would they start within this
and so they saw kind of two different options that really quickly were both viable and and of interest to them and
so as much as we just did if you guys want to drop in the chat you know which beachhead would you really recommend for
them one was to really focus on consumer focused ancestry research including
unknown relatives and surprising traits so you know learn if you can spell your
pee for instance after uh you eat asparagus another was to to work with
physicians in the FDA to enhance prenatal genetic screening which you
know I think parents in the room know is incredibly valuable within this let's
just start to see you know which would you recommend is it the ideal starting point for a research constrained a
startup leveraging this emerging technology
let me just give it a second here absolutely I love that people are are suggesting and we can do some
experimentation and and learning uh within us but so what's interesting is
is much like we saw with the other right you can take a reasonable set of people that are well informed and you will see
this tension in this debate about these alternative paths you know both are viable options
what they saw very quickly though is is these choices of initial Market of
initial beachhead had some ramifications on the mainstream market that they would build it would include you know not only
what that first product would be but the team that you would hire and those follow-on uh products that you would
release and how different stakeholders knew the value you created and in the
ecosystem itself and so really we wanted you guys to think about is that this choice of
beachhead is not just the one that really allows you to move to the mainstream market but is it in fact a
choice of which mainstream market you're going to go after we get within that
and so that allows us to really be even more strategic and thinking about this early choice of customers we'd
absolutely want a customer that we agree value for otherwise they won't buy they won't be a customer
but there's also in really thinking about and we have a Playbook to kind of go through this and we go through it in the course is thinking about how you can
pick that mainstream that beach had customer to really optimize your learning and experimentation within that
as well as your ability to build and make it to the the mainstream market and then that evolution of your company
itself and so really is this process of as Scott nicely walked through uh really
being concrete about what can you test really early on to help you understand uh both what are options that are
non-viable but also really understanding the different trade-offs and the different choices that will be important
among different viable options so that you can choose one and ultimately leave behind others at least temporarily to be
really focused in moving forward and so we see this in the choice of
customer but we also see these in these other core dimensions of choice as well and so this choice of Technology this
choice of innovation and how your company will leverage that is also where you need to be really concrete and
resurfacing what are your different options but then Focus ultimately so you can really make that uh a success and so
Mariana and nusha founded biobot analytics incredible company here out of
MIT and what they their hypothesis on how they created value is there's an
incredible amount of information in our sewers in fact There Was You Know hundreds of of things that they can
measure and they could catalog and so really an early choice for them was what
are we going to measure how are we going to make that accessible who are we going to make that accessible to individuals
community and governments how are we going to be going to really interface within those and ultimately they decided
very much to focus and those choices that they may about how they were going to develop that technology turned out to
be really instrumental in the pandemic and really monitoring the different levels of community spread of covet 19.
and so we want us to really think about those choice of technology so that you can be incredibly focused so you give
your idea and your Innovation the best chance of success especially important in these times where many Ventures are
more resource constrained than in the past words perhaps another core choice is your choice of
organization you can think of this as not only kind of your choice of co-founder but also your choice of which
capabilities and resources you're going to build and what you're going to access in the market more broadly and so you
know for gimlet which is really I think one of the many uh that have revolutionized uh you know the podcast
industry and particularly the long form of that uh Alex you know it was very
thoughtful in thinking about what capabilities he wanted to bring in as a co-founder um and really looking for that and
having honest conversations uh with Matt lever who we would go on to recruit
um as well as them both thinking about kind of those really how they would build out that organization that it
allowed it to be this leader in this space and ultimately their acquisition by Spotify within that
and then this last choice is this choice of competition where Scott and I often get folks saying wait a second you get
to choose your competition well you don't get to choose whether you have competition or I guess there's one way
not to have competition which is to have something no one wants to buy but good ideas involve competition and so
thinking about how you can really choose with whom you compete and the nature of that competition how you're going to
compete with them is something a choice that that entrepreneurs in fact have to spend a little bit of time on this
before you can bring it together into this entrepreneurial strategy compass and that that is that for a good idea
you can really consider this choice of with whom and how you're going to compete are you
going to orient more towards collaborating or more towards direct competition with the established players
are you going to invest in control or are you going to invest in execution and so your idea is really Center Stage here
and for most ideas you're able to really think along this full Compass this full Escape
and so let's look at that a little bit more another great MIT startup is pill pack
and pillpack really had this wonderful design Innovation that made it easier for folks to take their prescriptions
and one playbook in fact the Playbook advocated by many individuals was that they should they should focus on
licensing this to CVS and establish pharmacies like that is a well-worn path that brings success
but they ultimately decided in fact to compete and to build their own Pharmacy and those are very different types of
choices not only on the top level but also on the other complementary choices that you would need to make and so being
very concrete can be very Illuminating on the other dimension of this is this
control versus execution is saying you know early on are we going to really focus on controlling our ideas
uh through uh secrecy through uh patent protection and other avenues of
protection are we going to kind of get out there and really focus first and foremost on learning and execution and
Rapid iteration with our customers and with other stakeholders and so pale when
she was founding class pass actually really focused on this method of execution and learning that Contin it
kind of getting ahead and staying ahead and continuing to iterate and learn from her customers so that she could really
build out something that despite having you know the ability for others to enter and compete you were able to do and she
was able to build a billion dollar company that continues to create uh value for for gym goers but also gyms
around the world and so these two axises of collaborate
and compete and execution for control they come together as our organizing principle around thinking about strategy
for startups and with these there are other choices really take center stage and we see
these four bundles of choices uh these four strategy for startups and what's
really important here is that your idea is center stage and so your idea is not
necessarily confined to one strategy but as Scott has mentioned for most ideas
you're able to really consider multiple routes to commercialization and so just wanted to really introduce these
different strategies for startups today and so the first strategy is this intellectual property strategy this is
the ideas Factory this Innovation and continuing Innovation process think of
Dolby here and here you're going to invest in control and Orient through collaboration so you want to really gain
control through those patents trademarks Etc of these novel Innovations and then
use those control rights to really facilitate a trade in the market for ideas and to reduce commercialization
costs and Community competitive pressure so often you're not actually making the
final product you're collaborating with others to do in fact this is the The Playbook of Dolby was quite successful
in that process the next strategy very popular strategy
is the disruption strategy the hustlers or the creative destruction strategy and
this strategy is you know really where you're orienting towards competition but you're investing heavily in execution
and so in that initial customer group that you want to work with is for actually customer segments that are
currently underserved or poorly served by those existing firm's offers offering
so very different from partnering with an established firm and you want to use this process of iteration and learning
to really get ahead and stay ahead stay close to your your customer and and then slowly expand using those learnings uh
to mainstream customer segments and this is a Playbook that we've seen quite successful with Rent the Runway as well
as Salesforce and then the next strategy and this is
my my favorite strategy because I think it's the unsung hero of strategies for startups is the value stream strategy
and so here you're really focusing on this core competency you're just this partner with with your uh in this value
chain itself and so you're going to orient towards collaboration and invest heavily in execution within this and so
instead of A disruption strategy where you're investing in execution but you're going to the you know you're competing
against the established player here you're the you want to work to be their preferred partner right you want to
bring to market the best solution for this slice of the value chain and really find partners that are your
have a reputation for treating startups fairly and well and then continue through execution to own that slice of
the value chain and this is something that we've seen you know Infosys from their founding and then you know now
many decades later continue to really own and build out and maintain competitive advantage in that slice of
their value chain and then last but certainly not least is the architectural strategy this is kind
of the builders or the zero to one and here you're going to focus on orienting
towards competition and invest in control this is the most ambitious of strategies for startups and what you're
doing here is you're architecting an entirely new value Chain by coordinating with multiple stakeholders to provide
compelling new value for consumers within us and as you're architecting that new
strategy you want to really control a key resource or interface that will have enduring value where there's multiple
stakeholders itself and so this is something that we see you certainly see with open table that is
continued to really uh create value but also capture value uh by working with
restaurants and us as consumers when we need reservations to create value for both reportings
and so as you've probably seen as we go through this is you're starting to get a sense of not only are these different
orientations with respect to competition but that they implicitly involve different choices around your which
customer you're going to serve how you're going to serve them how you're going to innovate but also the organization that you're going to need
to build and so this is where the strategy Compass is really useful to think about those alternative routes to
commercialization and in particular especially these days more than ever you
need to be incredibly focused about what are the choices that we're going to have not only outward facing but externally
within that and be very concrete As you move forward I'm within this and so you know we see
this uh you know I think most sharply and when we see think about these different strategies really explicitly
on what those choices are right this value chain for instance very much about this partnership model uh with those
collaborators we're A disruption model is very very different early on
um focusing on entirely different customers uh within that moving forward and so it's by this early process of
experimentation that we're able to surface multiple Alternatives uh within
this we want to use that process of experimentation learning to leave behind certainly alternative routes that are
not viable But ultimately making a choice as to which one to focus on at least temporarily and then move forward
and so Scott's going to walk you through a startup that's done that yep so thank you so much Aaron
um so so you know we could well once again we really would love to work with you know anyone on the uh webinar here
you know you know we're going to offer this uh two-day course we have lots of materials um in these areas just to give
you a little bit of a flavor I know there's a lot here just to kind of break it really concrete let me just kind of give you a a very concrete example
um of a company that both Aaron and I have worked with quite uh closely since founding called rapid SOS uh here are
the founders of Michael Martin and Nick warlick um Michael was actually an HBS student
um you know everyone to make a mistake uh no that's not true we love HBS uh but uh and Nick corlick was a student here
at MIT um and they developed uh they kind of
focused on the need for mobile first emergency response so there's about six
seven years ago they were thinking about right there was a time when if you kind
of called on your mobile phone 9-1-1 for emergency response you might be the the
emergency response wouldn't know where you were I wouldn't be able to access any of the functionality of your
smartphone of your mobile phone they figured out a way to break through that technologically
they knew there was a lot of new technology they could bring to bear on that problem they weren't the first
people to recognize this problem but they had a kind of concrete advance that
said they kind of identified a potential solution to a problem that had previously evaded and then the question
is kind of right what should they do and so we started to work with them and
so um here was a a kind of little uh you know there's actually down in there this
was the entire company in their office uh down in New York at that time kind of as you can see you know very similar
kind of piece we were working with them at the time and their team kind of surfaced a bunch of alternative
strategies four nine one one just to kind of give you some examples right so on the one
hand maybe they should work with the big players in the industry such as Motorola
right Motorola has a dominant even though Motorola is a cell phone company kind of not as big but right Motorola
has so a dominant player in that emergency response space they went around to some Silicon Valley venture
capitals and they're like oh this is Uber for ambulances you should essentially replace the existing
government provided emergency response some insurance companies came to them
pretty much that value chain strategy and said we would love to see kind of people use this within our app that
could actually be cost saving to us because it kind of enhances emergency response which is cost you'll kind of
enhances our cost effectiveness and actually you know actually be a kind of
valuated feature of you know the apps right the kind of insurance company app
and finally I thought they started to start to talk to domestic violence agencies uh uh non-profits the American
Heart Association American epilepsy Association who sort of had kind of essentially a burning platform type
customer and they were actually able to use this process to kind of actually say you know
actually some of those options are really good down the line but aren't
good for us right now or if we start working with insurance companies right now who are willing to
put money on the table so we can keep the business afloat and not lose a lot of equity well that's actually going to
divert us from really kind of solving this at scale for the entire industry
and so they were able to use that process over time to really settle in this particular case they focus first on
that disruption strategy focusing on those um burning platform customers
that became a stepping stone to begin to grow and scale the company
um this is a technology that they are um is on every cell phone that uh you uh you might have on both they are the uh
lead of uh kind of Technology both within emergency response for the iPhone
um as well as with Android just give you a sort of sense of the impact that you
see right they had this idea does it actually save does it actually
have the impact they want and so let me just kind of play a little short video
courtesy of Apple
not no longer emergency car and I can't get out
what is your emergency
okay do not hang up
you by yourself yes have you tried to get out have you tried to bust the window or something it's a pretty torn
off and you don't change my cell phone I'm talking about Apple watch try to
keep talking to me okay okay
please hurry I'm hurting real bad you're gonna take help okay foreign
so all those are real stories right you know drawn very carefully by
Apple but really at scale what they were able to do was move that idea from just
being an idea that maybe existed in a research lab or was talked about in a
government report but they but Michael and Nick and their team were able to make those core
choices just as Aaron talked about organize them as part of an overall entrepreneurial strategy and use that as
a basis of scaling an impactful Venture I'm gonna hand it back to Aaron to kind
of do one more little Deep dive on how we kind of think about this and then and then we'll be and then we'll open up to
the Q a great thank you Scott um and so I just as we wrap up one and
tell a little bit about the course which is as much the same process actually that we work with uh with Nick and
Michael which is to really uh focus on really understanding these core choices that are facing as startup innovators I
really think about both that experimentation and learning as well as that implementation process of these
different strategies um and then ultimately to scale them and so that you can move forward and really
creating that impact that you want in the world with your idea um the folks that join are are folks
that have an idea that they are working on at all stages of Entrepreneurship um and those uh you know corporate
entrepreneurs investors and other stakeholders really wanting to understand this process the first day we
go through those core dimensions of Choice customer organization Tech and competition and then day two we start to
put these together with real live cases written on these entrepreneurs such as the ones we've highlighted today we're
really capturing those key moments of choice themselves and really how those choices really among those different
strategy strategies reflect their ecosystem but as others have mentioned in chat also their their perspective on
the impact that they want to create and their personality as I saw someone um in in the chat Mansion as well really
thinking through those because entrepreneurship is ultimately very a personal across apps
um and so just as we wrap up you know the power of Entrepreneurship is incredibly powerful I think is as Rob
started us with and it's not only to really start and identify these opportunities but it's really to move
those into the world and that requires making active Choice through the create value but also capture that value and
the more exciting The Innovation the more important in fact it is for strategy for your ability to really
commercialize that and build out that new company with competitive advantage and ultimately that process of choosing
an entrepreneurial strategy really forces you to come to terms with the core value that you'll be you'll create
um and especially in these times to be very disciplined in how you'll Focus uh to capture that value on a sustainable
basis so thank you guys so much we've been enjoyed uh seeing the chat so active and and hopefully we have some
time to take a few questions as well Aaron and Scott thank you so much it's
amazing how you were able to condense your material from your program into this short webinar and still provide
enough I think key details and information clearly from the chat uh the stream in the chat it's been useful for
a lot of our viewers today to learn more about your Frameworks and your research so thank you for doing that and to those
of you that have joined uh for the chat I've noticed several requests for this a recording of this we will make a
recording available in fact we have a whole library of similar this webinar
and similar similar webinars on our exec Ed website you'll have access to this webinar and many more through our
website as well we do have a lot of questions there has been great engagement I think the first one I'd
start with and this is open to either of you uh how to avoid test two choose to
as you're looking at this approach yeah so uh so thank you thank you so
much Robin thank you Aaron for everything the um so part of what you know you know one of the kind of key
insights I think that we had working with startups both in our on our research but also just working with
companies working with Founders is exactly they needed a framework that
they were poorly served by existing tools that did not focus them on the
importance of actual choice and so this choice-based approach what it does is it kind of identifies the
condition under which it's time to move forward down One path and leave those other
paths behind at least temporarily and gives a kind of methodology for doing so
what does it mean to actually go down a path means to actually undertake
learning and experimentation that involves more commitment than that
commitment free learning where all you are doing with surfacing possibilities and what and as I think Aaron already
kind of hinted at in the gimlet case what you tend to see is that those
almost right your first customers and your first employees
the first people who you start to bring on board all of a sudden they shoot the
path that you walk down and making that a choice rather than a something that happens to you and all of a sudden you
realize you're in a different place than you intended is very key to what we think allows for success
and even more important I think keeps entrepreneurs in sort of full control of
the choices they make and the impact they're likely to have I'm sure if you want to add on to that Aaron absolutely
I think you know one dimension that's incredibly important here and I've seen it in working with startups around
strategy is oftentimes we as particularly when we're co-founders we think we're implicitly building to the
same North Star and being very concrete about which strategy we're going after
actually helps prevent that test to choose two because you can start to really surface those conversations about
really concretely what do we want to build um and what are we leaving behind and so
often I've seen that some of the tensions and sometimes where the startup was making choices that weren't coherent
actually reflected two different visions of the company two different strategies and once those Founders were able to
have that concrete discussion the company uh not only just the founders but also the team and the other
stakeholders were able to more concretely build and more successfully build to that future
great thank you both and just uh we're approaching the top of the hour I do want to just call attention to the slide
that's presented right now uh the next running of this program will be on March 23rd and March 24th as you see the
format for this delivery will be live online which we've become very Adept at running these programs live online and
making them very interactive with breakout groups and polling and functionality like that one thing that
we've discovered over the past few years is by offering these programs live online it enables people to attend uh
more openly from around the world they don't have to travel to Cambridge and they can log in from their own desks or
home and participate fully in the program but we do anticipate that we'll be running additional dates in in 2023
actually I see this is 2022. in 2023 we'll be running this first program live online and expect to add other programs
that will run here on the MIT campus as well so whether you're joining us here on campus or online we certainly hope to
see you and would welcome you to uh to join us in one of our MIT classrooms I guess with with just probably about time
enough for one final question um Aaron Scott I wanted to get your thoughts on kind of the Tipping Point
for strategy for startups is there a point I think of so often how we have startups here in the Kendall Square area
that are at local accelerators or incubators and they outgrow their their startup space and then kind of move into
established more established office space or physical presence is there an equivalent for strategy for startups do
you get to a point in an organization where you need to take a different approach to strategy and if so what what
point is that so so the so really you know I know
we're at the top of the hour and thank you Rob so one point I would make is that you know we've worked with lots of
uh former students companies that find some of these tools valuable for
corporate entrepreneurship for new initiatives for even just kind of surfacing New Alternatives
um within existing business but one of the things that I would say you know the the compass and the kind of core tools
provide is they they let you kind of get to the
point where you have the resources and capabilities you have the reputation and
commitments that allow some of those more traditional Strategic Management tools
right kind of your very traditional tools that do involve very often kind of you know should I go Global how should I
think about expanding to an adjacent Market what does it mean to kind of build out you know a multi-net you know
a a multi-site Workforce whatever that might be all of those core tools of
strategic management at some point come into play to me that crystallization comes from
strategy for startups is fundamentally about choosing the path and undertaking
the initial rounds of scale once you've scaled a viable business
now is the time that then some of those other tools can also be brought on board
make sure if you want to add up onto that Aaron I agree you know and I see this a bit in
the in a chat about evolving strategies yeah and go into this in the course
um much more detail but is thinking about how you lay up that initial entrepreneurial strategy sometimes into
a into what we call more of a success pivot into another entrepreneurial strategy and then moving into
competitive strategy and it's really thinking about an entrepreneurial strategy a strategy for startups is
really laying that foundation on which you're going to build that competitive advantage and that broader impact as
your organization and your Venture grows foreign and I see that we've just reached the
top of the hour so Aaron Scott thank you again thank you to all my colleagues here on the marketing team at MIT Sloan
Executive Education that helped organize and run this event today thank you to all of you that have connected from
around the world to join us for the past hour I hope that you found that the content and information both useful and
and relevant to the work that you're doing as entrepreneurs innovators and anybody that's in this wonderful startup
