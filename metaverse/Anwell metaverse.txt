Anwell metaverse
Here is one hypothetical scenario where Anwell could have pursued alternate strategies at each stage and potentially been more profitable:

Nail Stage (2000-2004):

- Instead of collaborating with suppliers and distributors, Anwell could have tried to control more of the value chain by acquiring a raw materials company and distribution channels early on. This would be an Architectural Strategy (Compete & Control).

- Benefits: More control over the full value chain, ability to integrate operations and reduce costs, capture more profit margin.

- Risks: Larger capital outlay, execution challenges with acquisitions, spread too thin early on.

Scale Stage (2004-2008): 

- Rather than competing directly with established brands, Anwell could have licensed technology to them or partnered as an OEM supplier. This would be a Value Chain Strategy (Collaborate & Execute).

- Benefits: Reduce risks of head-to-head competition, leverage partners' brands and sales channels.

- Risks: Give up some control and margin, still vulnerable to changing market conditions.

Sail Stage (2008-2013):

- With control over more of the value chain from the nail stage, Anwell could have focused on incremental innovation and optimizing operations. This would be an Intellectual Property Strategy (Collaborate & Control).

- Benefits: Less risky innovation, focus on maximizing profits on core business.

- Risks: Vulnerable to disruption, less incentive to expand into new markets.

This alternate scenario reduces some of the competitive risks but also depends on successful acquisitions and partnerships in the early stages. The key advantage would be having more control over the integrated value chain to maximize profits during the sail stage. But it's hard to predict if it would actually be more profitable than Anwell's real trajectory. The analysis shows how the entrepreneurial compass can be used to consider alternative strategies.
