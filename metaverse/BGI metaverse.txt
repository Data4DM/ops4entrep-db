BGI metaverse
Here is one alternative scenario that could have been more profitable for BGI:

Nail Stage:

Instead of just executing on sequencing, BGI could have tried to patent some of its innovations from the Human Genome Project participation. This would have given it more control and allowed it to collaborate from a position of strength later on.

Scale Stage: 

Rather than only collaborating with partners, BGI could have competed directly with sequencing companies by marketing its services aggressively to end customers. This disruption strategy could have allowed it to grow faster and capture more profits.

Sail Stage:

BGI might have tried an architectural strategy - competing and controlling the health care platforms it is developing. By owning the platform, it could establish a dominant position rather than having to split value with health care partners.

In summary, more focus on control and IP in the Nail stage, direct competition in the Scale stage, and tighter platform control in the Sail stage could have made BGI even more profitable than its current trajectory. The key would have been leveraging its technical innovations more assertively early on to gain strategic advantage.
