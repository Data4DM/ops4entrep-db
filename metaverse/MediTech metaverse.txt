MediTech metaverse
Here is one hypothetical scenario where MediTech could have potentially been more profitable by changing its strategy in the Nail and Scale stages:

Nail Stage:

- Strategy: Architectural Strategy (Compete & Control)

Instead of collaborating with established suppliers, MediTech could have decided to vertically integrate and develop more components in-house. This would allow them to control and protect key technologies through patents and proprietary knowledge. They would be competing directly against large incumbents by trying to disrupt the industry with their new product.

Scale Stage: 

- Strategy: Disruption Strategy (Compete & Execute)

After developing the prototype and securing intellectual property protection, MediTech could focus on competing through speed and iteration. Instead of architecting a complex supply chain, they could streamline operations and get to market quickly with a minimum viable product. This would allow them to gain a first mover advantage and start disrupting incumbent competitors.

With this combination, MediTech would control key technologies during development, and then compete through agile execution during scaling. The focus would be on competing against and disrupting established players rather than collaborating with them as suppliers. 

This could potentially be more profitable by allowing MediTech to capture more value through intellectual property and speed to market. However, it also carries more risk and would require more internal capabilities and resources to execute.
