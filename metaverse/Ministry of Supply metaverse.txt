Ministry of Supply metaverse
Here's a short story depicting an alternative entrepreneurial journey for Ministry of Supply:

The Pivot

Fresh out of MIT, Gihan and Aman were eager to disrupt the men's fashion industry. They had invented a novel performance fabric that breathed like athleticwear but looked sharp like a dress shirt.

The partners debated whether to manufacture it themselves or license the patent to an established brand. Aman pushed to keep production in-house to control quality and protect their secret sauce. Gihan worried the capital costs would strap their fledgling startup.

They decided to collaborate and executed a licensing deal with Brooks Brothers. The royalty checks provided valuable validation, but soon large retailers were hawking cheap knockoffs. Gihan and Aman realized they needed to compete directly.

They pivoted, investing their IP income into their own factory. Their premium shirts flew off the shelves. Within years, Ministry of Supply became the #1 performance menswear brand.

But rapid growth came at a cost. Overwhelmed by scaling headwinds, Ministry took on venture capital and began to lose its identity. Gihan longed for those early scrappy days when it was just them against the world.

"We need to get back to our roots," Gihan told Aman. "Let's open source our old designs to encourage an ecosystem of collaborators and devote more energy to executing new tech."

By refocusing on their founding values, Ministry rediscovered its innovative spirit. The partners learned that entrepreneurship isn't about sticking to one strategy - sometimes you have to pivot.
