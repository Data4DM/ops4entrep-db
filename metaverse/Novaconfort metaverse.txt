Interesting suggestion to consider alternative strategies Novaconfort could have pursued at each stage. Here is one alternative scenario I think could have been profitable:

Nail Stage: 
- Same Value Chain Strategy to learn the business.

Scale Stage:
- Switch to Architectural Strategy (Compete & Control)
- Develop proprietary processes and technology to gain competitive advantage in construction methods. File patents to protect IP.  
- Leverage IP and improved processes to compete directly for contracts, including against established firms.
- Invest in own equipment and vertically integrate parts of supply chain to control quality and costs.

Sail Stage: 
- Architectural Strategy
- Leverage earlier investments in proprietary IP and processes to keep leading the market. 
- Expand equipment fleet and vertical integration to continue controlling costs and quality.
- Use strong market position to strengthen negotiating power with suppliers.

The rationale is that investing early on to develop proprietary technology and processes, protect IP, and bring key parts of the supply chain in-house could have enabled Novaconfort to differentiate itself, gain more bargaining power, and sustain higher profits over the long term. The Architectural Strategy could have allowed it to compete against the larger players rather than just collaborating, if it was able to create and control unique innovations. However, this would have been riskier and required more upfront investment. The Value Chain Strategy provided a safer path but may have left more money on the table long term.
