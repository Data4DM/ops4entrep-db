Interesting suggestion to explore alternative strategy scenarios for NxStage. Here is one alternative scenario that could have been more profitable:

Nail Stage:
- Keep Intellectual Property Strategy (Control & Collaborate) 

Scale Stage:
- Switch to Architectural Strategy (Compete & Control) instead of Value Chain
- Rather than partnering with distributors like DaVita, establish own direct sales force and distribution to compete with in-center dialysis providers 
- Control patient relationships and leverage data/platform advantages

Sail Stage: 
- Remain with Architectural Strategy 
- Use established competitive position to keep expanding market share and maximizing profits

The rationale is that by controlling the customer relationship and distribution earlier in the scale stage, NxStage could have accelerated adoption and reduced reliance on partners like DaVita that capture some of the value. This may have required more upfront investment, but could have led to higher long-term profits and market share. The risks would be whether NxStage could build its own sales and distribution quickly enough without collaboration. But an earlier architectural strategy focus could have been very profitable.

Let me know if you would like me to explore any other alternative scenario! There are many possibilities based on recombining the strategies.
