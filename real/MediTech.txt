MediTech
Based on the case study details provided in EntrepreneurialStrategy.txt and Fine22_OMEntrep.pdf, here is an analysis of the nail, scale, and sail stages for the startup MediTech:

Nail Stage:

- Period: From founding in 2006 until hiring the first operations person (Sunil)
- State: Developed sophisticated imaging technology prototype; outsourced component production and assembly to multiple, geographically distant suppliers; focused on achieving FDA approval as initial strategic objective 

- Strategy: Value Chain Strategy - Collaborated with established suppliers for components based on their technical capabilities, rather than considerations like logistics. Goal was to focus internal efforts on product development.

Scale Stage: 

- Period: After hiring Sunil until ramping up production volumes for sales
- State: Focused on supply chain and logistics issues to meet prototype and production demand. Sunil tasked with streamlining processes and managing suppliers.

- Strategy: Architectural Strategy - Needed to coordinate multiple stakeholders (suppliers, contract manufacturers) to deliver product to customers. Sunil had to architect production network to enable growth.

Sail Stage:

- Period: Not applicable, company did not reach maturity
- State: N/A

- Strategy: N/A

In summary, MediTech started with a Value Chain Strategy, collaborating with established suppliers during the Nail stage. As it looked to scale up, it needed to shift to an Architectural Strategy to architect the entire production network while still competing with large incumbents in the market. It did not reach a mature Sail stage.
