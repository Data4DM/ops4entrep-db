Novaconfort
Based on the Novaconfort case study and the definitions of nail, scale, and sail stages, here is my analysis of the startup's journey through each stage and the entrepreneurial strategy chosen in each stage:

Nail Stage (2005 - 2008):

- Period: 2005 - 2008, the first 3 years of the company
- State: Started as a small family business with no prior experience in construction. Focused on learning the business through taking on small renovation projects, hiring experts to teach them, taking detailed notes. Built capabilities through learning by doing. Developed network of experts and suppliers. 
- Strategy: Value Chain Strategy - Collaborated with experts and suppliers to learn, relied on execution and learning to build capabilities rather than trying to control IP or compete directly.

Scale Stage (2008 - 2013): 

- Period: 2008 - 2013, after initial learning period
- State: Had developed construction capabilities. Started taking on larger, more complex construction projects. Refined and standardized processes, focused on quality materials and meeting deadlines. Expanded network of reliable suppliers.  
- Strategy: Value Chain Strategy - Continued collaborating with experts and suppliers to execute larger projects. Leveraged expertise to compete for projects but not directly against established firms.

Sail Stage (2013 - Present):

- Period: 2013 - Present, after surviving economic crisis 
- State: Established as one of the leading regional construction companies. Focused on sustaining the business. Confronting some scaling constraints due to reluctance to expand financing and management outside founding family.
- Strategy: Value Chain Strategy - Has sustained success by maintaining collaborative relationships in value chain and focusing on effective execution of projects. Not pursuing IP strategy and not directly competing against large established firms.

In summary, Novaconfort appears to have followed the Value Chain Strategy throughout its evolution, leveraging collaboration and execution as a small startup to learn and build capabilities, then collaborating with suppliers and experts to scale up operations, and sustaining success by staying focused on its core competencies in project execution. The Value Chain Strategy allowed them to grow steadily within the ecosystem instead of competing directly against established players.
