Unity Homes 
Based on the entrepreneurial compass framework and the Unity Homes case study, here is an analysis of the strategies used in each stage:

Nail Stage (2012-2013):

- Time period: 2012-2013 when Unity Homes was incorporated and launched

- State: 
  - Organization - Small team, relied heavily on Bensonwood capabilities
  - Process - Focused on developing modular home platforms using Bensonwood's design and manufacturing expertise
  - Capabilities - Leveraged Bensonwood's timber framing, CAD design, and offsite manufacturing capabilities
  - Vision - Provide high-quality, sustainable, customizable homes at mass market prices
  - Finance - Relied on internal funding from Bensonwood initially

- Strategy: Value Chain - Collaborated with Bensonwood for capabilities and executed on developing product platforms 

Scale Stage (2013-future): 

- Time period: 2013 onwards as Unity looks to scale up

- State:
  - Organization - Planning to expand capabilities beyond Bensonwood
  - Process - Looking to streamline and integrate processes from design to production
  - Capabilities - Developing own production facilities and supply chain
  - Vision - Becoming a national homebuilder through replication
  - Finance - Seeking external capital to fund growth

- Strategy: Architectural - Competing directly in homebuilding by controlling key interfaces while collaborating with channel partners

Sail Stage:

- Unity Homes has likely not reached a maturity stage yet where growth rates stabilize. The sail stage would come in the future once the scaling strategy has been executed successfully.

- At that stage, the focus would shift towards optimizing operations, quality, cost reduction rather than rapid growth. 

- The architectural strategy would likely continue, but with a shift from control towards efficiency and optimization. Collaboration within the ecosystem would increase.

In summary, Unity Homes started with a value chain strategy by leveraging Bensonwood's capabilities in the nail stage. As it looks to scale and control the homebuilding value chain, it is moving towards an architectural strategy. The sail stage would see optimization of the architectural strategy.
